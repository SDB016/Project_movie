Team4 project in Tips

This project is a project using easywin32.
After users watch the movie, they register the movie in this program, give it a star rating, and write a comment. After that, it is a program that identifies the trends of movies with high stars and recommends movies to be released to users. By parsing the web based on the Naver movie site, director information, actor information, and movie genre are retrieved and identified.
